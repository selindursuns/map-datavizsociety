As a result, I was able to take Algebra in the eighth grade. In eighth grade, they incorporated an \"ACE\" program. The ACE program allowed me to essentially skip a grade, but still be in the same graduating class. The teachers did an excellent job of preparing us for more advanced classes; the transition from seventh grade to ninth grade level classes in one year was made simple. The middle school also did an excellent job at providing extra-curricular activities for students...."

One example would be my friend who had dislexia and transferred to the Mendell at the beginning of second grade. The teacher was able to help her get from way below the ELA reading standards to above the standard despite her insistence that she couldn't read.

They made it feel like a team effort instead of a lonely and scary process.

There is the occasional hard teacher who gives you a tough time, but for the most part if you're open, communicative, do your work, and pay attention you'll do very well. The Administration fell apart after the principal and vice principal left, now they've seemed to get things back under control. However, somebody thought it would be a good idea not to renew the contract of the theatre manager. Lots of people were upset over this decision because of how fabulous he was. He wasn't just great at what he did, but he helped anyone with anything. Now they have a new theatre manager who works part time from home whereas the previous two were full time and always running around seeing to general maintenance in the theatre. Seeing as it's a really nice theatre, it's too bad to see so little going on in the theatre. They do have new band and theatre teachers though, so it will be interesting to see what they fight for...."

Friendships made at Parker are still quite strong today. Interests that grew in the 7th-12th grades are hobbies today. Parker taught them how to BE students and thinkers. Teachers care so much about their students. Students develop public speaking, presentation, & communication skills. They develop habits for learning & take those habits into college and work.They learn how to listen & how to ask questions. Parker offers real-world learning.

This year they are preparing us for Jr. High so we have two \"main\" teachers who are both really nice in their own ways. One thing I dislike about the school is the food, if you are considering  sending your child her make sure to pack their lunch!

We are so lucky with the amount of education and 1:1 attention each of our children received when they were here whether academically or emotionally as they grew.

The students are very well prepared for life after Grade 5 as they transition into the Middle School on the other side of town. There are many offerings before and after school from Gym, Orff, to Art and Service Club...plus many outside athletic organizations that offer sports after school.

I can't say the academics were horrible, because I learned a few things, but I was never \"challenged.\" There was minimal homework to back up what we learned, which didn't help much with the fact that we were there to learn. I liked most of my teachers. My favorite experiences were in 5th and 6th grade. In 5th grade for our exhibitions, my class created a website called the \"Team 5 Times.\" Another one of my favorite 5th-grade projects was the Oregon Trail. We turned our desks and tables into wagons, used power tools, and made our own games. (I made a geyser and helped with the Oregon Trail game). My favorite 6th-grade moments were Nature's Classroom (a 3-day overnight field trip) and our class play. Overall, Douglas wasn't the best place to learn and grow academically, but there are still many great experiences...."

Teachers respond to communications extremely fast and with a high level of thoughtfulness.  It is a college prep school that assists its' students with a hands-on approach to the college application process. HCSS consistently shows their forward momentum by trying to offer more extra curriculars and athletic programs.   They also offer an array of AP courses that can be taken starting Freshman year.  lastly, HCSS's approach to safety is top notch.  Security guards are onsite daily, safety procedures are practiced (ie. drills) and there is clear visitor protocol.  Overall, I highly recommend this school to any parents looking for an alternative to a traditional public school experience...."

BUT, For Fallbrook, the school, & faculty, I give 5 stars (If My child was an angel). I took 1 star away for labeling ADHD at age 6! ADHD is a dr\u2019s diagnose. These are small kids going to school for the first time & in my honest opinion every issue I\u2019ve had since K, ( My son is now in 2nd) has been attended to, not only 1-on-1 but with added support of the District. There are Special programs for kids that need it, lots of events and fun fairs. The principle is perfect for an elementary school even when I was upset he never changed his \u201cpositive\u201d ways.  Im glad my son is attending this school. He has an AWESOME teacher this year. I would Recommend Fallbrook Elementary to anyone that would ask...."

I do hope that the coaches in high school athletics begin to pay more attention to the attitudes and feelings that athletes have towards their teammates, and address those issues when necessary, and involve administrators when necessary. The protection of students is the most important and was sometimes overlooked due to favoritism. But I did enjoy my time at Wahconah and I am glad I chose to school choice there!..."

It is an amazing experience that allows students to delve into areas that they may be interested in but cannot take at the school due to the school not offering the elective.

The hands-on learning approach is commendable, providing practical skills alongside traditional academics. However, Worcester Tech isn't without its flaws.

Additionally, some teachers seem more focused on sticking to the curriculum than connecting with students on a personal level. The school culture can be hit or miss. In the end, Worcester Technical High School is what you make of it. It's not perfect, but it's not a lost cause either...."

Through the years I have built strong relationships with teachers and administrators. I loved the drama club (which unfortunately may not have funding to continue), the school often does spirit weeks, mindfulness weeks, kindness weeks, etc. The school has a nice community with great parent involvement in the PTA! I've also observed plenty of extra help for students struggling academically. It was great having a pool in the basement of the school too! The Makerspace and STEAM focus in my more recent years has also been really nice. Overall, I've loved the Kennedy, and I can't think of any complaints from my experience...."

        "review": "Comment:Middle School Student:I started middle school a few months ago. The only thing wrong was BTA, or Blanchard Theatre Arts. The 6th graders get neglected a lot. When an actor gets their makeup done wrong or something else, other 7th and 8th graders say, \"Oh! Was it a 6th grader?\" I've seen that happen many times before. Be careful, and if you can't take that stuff, go to Mrs. Sacco, our director. She's very kind. No parents will worry about academics. I'm sure by the time we reach high school, we'll be ready to take on the world. There are many varieties of food as well, like yogurt, salad, fruit gummies, fruit in general, and muffins. Muffins are mostly for breakfast though, and yes, they give out breakfast. Drinks include milk, soda, and water on most days. Our band teacher is really funny too! Lastly, the janitors make the school squeaky clean, so no need to worry about bugs crawling all over the place. Overall, Blanchard Middle School is excellent. I would definitely recommend going there...."

It was better before COVID but due to covid they switched to pre-packaged food. It wasn't terrible, but I never found myself looking forward to anything other than the cookies, which remained the same. The Theatre program puts on good shows, but I found that the same students were always cast as the lead roles year after year. The school was very accommodating towards me when I had a mental health crisis, which I really appreciated. I felt that the Health class was very comprehensive and informative.

The teachers are very caring and they offer help whenever asked. Teachers also stay after school for office hours which helps a ton when I need to understand a specific topic or subject.Comment:As captain of the soccer team and part of the tennis team, and also working closely with the athletic director, the athletic scene is very well run and a very fun experience for all students and even parents too. Comment:One of the few issues I've had was the bad food and extremely long traffic before school.

We attended a second open house/tour with our Daughter in the fall who immediately felt that this was the school and community she wanted to be a part of. The Admissions team put together wonderful events on campus that would give us all more insight into their curriculum, values and community. Needless to say our Daughter applied early and was accepted. We are so excited to be part of AP's community and to see where her Austin journey will take her!..."

Everyone that I have met have been nice and I haven't worried about issues such as bullying. She goes to school happy every day, so learning comes naturally.Comment:2. Academics. I like that she is exposed to a different language. One parent explained to me that kids may not test as well in English (but surprisingly, MLK kids test just as well in English as kids from other Cantabridgian schools) because they spend half of their day learning another language. There are no standardized tests that measures the fact that you're learning another language.Comment:3. Parents. They're  great people that I'd like to hang out with even if we didn't have kids.

The school does create a good environment for extracurricular clubs, and I've found that the Asian Student Association, along with the Diversity Inclusion Group, among many others, fill in the gap for minority groups to come together. The academic system is also challenging to students and incorporates a variety of different classes many others schools do not hold, such as many computer sciences, automotive classes, partnership programs (child study, criminal justice), and the STEM classes are really good at introducing kids to higher level labs.

Doesn't deserve to be named*. They got me ready for Middle School, High School, and helped me find what I wanted to do at an early age. May not be the same for you or your child, but for me, it worked. If I ever stay in the area, I would 100% send my kid to this school.

In my AP Physics we will be building a trebuchet, which allows hands-on experience to engage in real world studies. Unique to other schools is our Patriot Pride day held twice a year where everyone in the school wears our school colors, red white and blue, and we don't have class that day but have blow up obstacle courses, barbecue food, yard games, popcorn machine and more which all the students get to enjoy outside without having schoolwork. A change I would like to see is the introduction of AP classes through freshman year, or a better handling of schedules.

The English department in particular is fantastic, as they prepare students to write, think, and analyse at a very high level. As a current college student, it is evident that I received a much more rigorous education than many of my peers who attended other schools. The teachers here went above and beyond to prepare me for college, and the quality of education I received at Hampshire is entirely thanks to their dedication.Comment: It's truly a shame that the administration and school committee don't value the educators here and are unwilling to negotiate with the union or pay them the wage they deserve. It reflects very poorly on the administration to undervalue the educators. Hampshire has a good academic reputation in the area, which is due to the quality of the teachers rather than the administrators...."

Some of the teachers are really wonderful, smart, creative and caring. We loved Mrs. Yau for K, Mrs. Hannifran for 1st, Mrs. Smith for 3rd. Ms. Rosenthal for science in 5th, 6th grade, and both STEM class teachers. Since the school is large, you can ask for your child to be assigned to a particular teacher you think s/he would work well with. The student body is diverse and the parents are friendly.  Like all of Malden\u2019s public schools, the classrooms are getting a bit crowded as class sizes grow to big for the design of the building.

That being said, there can still be improvements made in the quality of classes, specifically course material, and much of this comes from many of the challenges that all public schools face regarding standardized testing and material...."

There were many connections and opportunities presented to the students that went to Gardner Middle School. The academics challenged everyone to the best of their abilities. If anyone fell behind there was tutoring and after-school service to help them. There are multiple clubs after-school to get the students involved in other activities that they might want to try. Teachers and faculty were friendly and helpful towards their students, parents, guardians, and outside visitors.

I especially like that it feels like a family. For my only child, that is especially important - that he have role models who are an extension of our family at home. My child has grown and bloomed in every way, thriving in this environment where the teachers truly love and care for each student. Before the school year even began we got a letter from the teacher saying that she was praying for our children and that their year in her classroom would be blessed. The curriculum is top notch and the environment is so positive and encouraging. The opportunities for learning within the classroom and beyond are amazing.

One aspect of NAHS that I would like to see progression and change in is the mental health department. I believe that we should have a more enriching outlet to our mental troubles and more accommodations for student troubles. I believe in mental health days and support groups through the school, as that suggestion is something NAHS should consider. I feel sometimes like my mental health issues are undermined and that I need a better outlet for when I feel lonely, pondering how our school could insert a support group into the curriculum for at least outside activities. Overall, the school does a great job of inclusion of clubs and activities, especially the arts which I am particularly interested in, and I have not had any major issues with attending this high school despite the mental health one I pointed out...."

They also treat students extremely well, one of the teachers even adjusted his class rules around sleeping in class for a student who had to work to support their family and could barely get enough sleep. The courses are also not designed purely to meet district criteria and instead they are made to get students to retain the information and even ti provide skills outside of course required materials such as financial literacy, college prep, what loans and mortgages are, what credit scores are and how important it is to avoid debt among other things.

Exhibitions allowed him to grow in self confidence and overcome his apprehension of public speaking. The current staff are wonderfully engaged and the administration and leadership team are fully supportive of teacher lead learning. The school draws students from the surrounding towns, thus the diversity of the student body, racially, socially and economically is real.

True to Montessori principles, students learn in multi-age classrooms -- stretching the younger students and giving the older students opportunities to be authentic mentors. My kids have built multi-year relationships with teachers who truly know them as learners and as people. Rather than sitting at desks and moving through the curriculum lock-step, students work at tables or on the floor (on workmats) and are giving the opportunity to move at their own pace, under the guidance of well-trained teachers.  They also spend time in nature and working on a farm! The result is high-engagement, high-curiosity, and low-stress. In three years, elementary-age children have not once complained about going to school. In a time of pressurized childhood, this school allows children to be children -- and that's the secret to their students' cognitive, social, and emotional growth...."

All of that being said I think there are areas for NDA to grow in. The diversity of students and staff is not representative of the world beyond NDA. I also think there is an entitled culture that is probably prevalent at other private schools, but requires girls to be grounded in reality to see through that. The school has also been through a lot of faculty, staff, and administrative turnover since I graduated a few years ago. I hope that with a new administration team this won't remain such an issue.

I really appreciate all of the arts programs that NHS has to offer. There is really something for everyone, whether it's classes or clubs or volunteer opportunities. NHS is very connected to the community and really gets the students involved. I always feel very welcome and supported by everyone at this school. In my experience, there isn't a lot of bullying, there are a few fights but nothing crazy. Teachers also get students to advocate for themselves a lot. I particularly like that some teachers stay after school for a while to help students or just talk to them to help them. The school is also very easy to navigate.

That is more the students fault than the administration, and I suppose that this could be true of any school. While it may have some flaws socially, Tantasqua, as I mentioned before, has strong academics. There is a wide variety in class choice, as well as a vocational program. After taking required classes, students have the opportunity to learn about their interests, which I find kind of unique. For the most part, Tantasqua is a good school with a lot of cool opportunities...."

All of that being said I think there are areas for NDA to grow in. The diversity of students and staff is not representative of the world beyond NDA. I also think there is an entitled culture that is probably prevalent at other private schools, but requires girls to be grounded in reality to see through that. The school has also been through a lot of faculty, staff, and administrative turnover since I graduated a few years ago. I hope that with a new administration team this won't remain such an issue.

However, the school's infrastructure and resources sometimes fell short of supporting the ambitious projects and innovative ideas students had, which was a noticeable drawback. Additionally, while the school spirit was generally high, I observed that more could be done to ensure inclusivity and support for every student, particularly in terms of mental health resources and academic assistance for those struggling. Moving forward, I'd love to see Andover High invest in modernizing facilities and expanding support services to better meet the needs of its diverse student body, ensuring every student has the tools and environment to thrive...."

I am especially grateful to go to a school that has such a tight-knit community. As a student of both the arts and music department, I have been able to foster my creative talent in a way that I would not have been able to without the teachers I have worked with. I have felt welcomed by staff and students in ways that have changed my life. But, as a white student, I have experienced privileges at LHS that non-white students do not have. Though I can say that the staff at Longmeadow High School seem to work hard to advocate against discrimination and racism, not all students feel this way. Even I can see the racism that other students endure from peers. I hope that there can be more of an effort to discourage discrimination and provide a tighter sense of community for students of color, and for Jewish and Muslim students as well...."

I was tired of it. When my family moved to Uxbridge, I decided to join Uxbridge High School midway through junior year. I quickly went from being known as the \u201cNew Kid\u201d to being one of the most popular kids in my grade  due to my charismatic and empathetic nature, and my younger peers look up to me as a mentor and somewhat of an older brother figure. Though I didn\u2019t make it onto the student election ballot, one of my friends took me out of class one day and went out of his way to help me get signatures, and that is something I\u2019ll never forget.

Almost every single team here is competitive at the regional level as well as the state level. Being apart of a soccer team who went to the Central Massachusetts tournament and the MIAA state tournament felt surreal as an athlete. Although going to football, soccer, and basketball games reminded me that the school is passionate regardless of the sport. All teams performed amazingly and the student sections were the extra player for our teams. The academics overall I believe are really good, there are lots of electives offered with teachers who enjoy teaching the classes. The teachers here are very passionate in what they do, no matter the subject. There isn't much I would like to see change except the diversity in the school, which has slowly been growing over many years, which I think is great. My overall experience at MHS has been great! I wouldn't change a thing!..."

There haven't been many times where I've felt like I needed more out of school, and I always had adequate opportunities. The biggest problems with the school are not with the opportunities, but in my opinion how the rules are sometimes enforced. There seems to sometimes be biased when the administration treats certain students better or worse than others, or being more relaxed with some than others. The food also kind of sucks...."

The teachers here are always advocating in one way or another for a student's needs when it comes to academics. The guidance counselors are also very helpful, and I enjoy the efforts in trying to raise awareness of the music & arts within schools here, something that you do not see often in other places unfortunately. Comment:The only \"bad\" thing I've experienced is just within the student body; I have definitely heard of drama that goes around but its nothing too serious. Just a lot of kids saying stuff towards each other but problems like this seem to be handled quite effectively because of teachers and the office. Overall, I've enjoyed my time here, and will come back to visit my teachers post-graduation!..."

Something to consider changing I would have to say is sometimes the lack of adaptability to students needs. I will say I personally have struggled in the past years even with the extra help , maintain a strong sense of my math curriculum. The clubs, and sports the school offers however are brood, and there is something for everyone. The opportunity to express yourself and your interests is endless throughout the school.

We have had some bad downfalls; fights breaking out, bad teachers, bad food outbreaks etc. Yet at least, my sad, but fairly casual experience, wasn't labeled as one taken at our rivals- DY and Nauset. I liked the opportunities we had, as we were probably the school with the most arts programs, diverse clubs, and creative options regarding electives- but we were totally not stinky and DY. This is why I like not being stinky (like our rivals) and always at loss with Barnstable High's sports teams.  Barnstable is cool I guess...."

The administration is a hit or miss, sometimes they are helpful other times they will go out of their way to make your experience difficult. Sports-wise the school isn't so great, and by that I mean our football team. If our head of athletics funded the other sports we would have a solid overall sports presence but they only care about our really bad football team.

The staff, especially the music faculty, is dedicated and fantastic at working with young people. In our family's experience, the turnover in the math & science faculty at that time didn't help our student stay engaged in those subjects as she otherwise have. However, our student worked very hard, received excellent grades and got into a good college to pursue her artistic education...."

Additionally, through my Engineering shop, I was able to take on a co-op experience at only age 17 at Rochester Electronics in Newburyport, MA. This co-op experience is probably the best part of my high school experience. This educational institution offers numerous sports, including soccer, which I participated in for my four years, becoming a varsity player as just a freshman. I took three APs during my time at this high school, including AP biology, AP U.S. history, and AP calculus. The worst part regarding my experience was probably the lack of AP options, but they did offer them nonetheless. I would suggest adding a few more. Overall, this is a great institution, the administration truly cares about their students and go out of their way to make the school more advanced and work everyday to improve this educational experience...."

I believe KIPP's motive to always try to improve is very admirable, and though I believe there's much that needs to be improve, the school overall is very safe and resourceful. I appreciate the staffs efforts to have a relationship with their students (professionally ofc.) and appreciate the teachers different approaches to teaching.

The teacher-to-student ratio is crucial, and this school ratio is excellent since it's a small school. All the staff is friendly and creates a warm family atmosphere for the students. I have met some of the best teachers in the school, who motivated me to pursue higher education. They also provide rigorous learning for the students by now offering freshman high schoolers the opportunity to graduate with their associate's degree. The only downside is the lack of sports; they don't offer sports such as basketball, soccer, baseball, cheering, etc. They also don't host significant events like pep rallies; instead, they do a student-teacher volleyball game. The food is also not the best; some days are good, but they're rare. Since it's a charter school, the students are required to wear uniforms, a navy or burgundy color with khakis pants...."

Pathfinder has honors classes and their placement testing is very good at making sure you can be in more advanced classes and continue to be challenged academically. Pathfinder does have extracurricular activities that may not be as competitive as some other local schools, but I think they have more options for things like drama club, and inclusive activities than other school options. The school resources available at Pathfinder have been much better than my old high school. They take safety more seriously and counselors are more available to students who might have an IEP or 504 plan. Overall I enjoy Pathfinder Tech, but I would like if they had more options for transportation after school...."

This school has pushed me to my limits in academics and athletics, and I work hard in both. I now hold the school record there, and my name is there to be shown as a memory. This school is made of more than just memories, its full of unforgettable bonds. I've never experienced this anywhere else in my childhood/high school years...."

There had been no assessments, only occasional presentations. Some positive experiences at my school were my other passion, music. The music department had been a great comfort throughout my four years. I had participated in courses such as chorus, guitar, and the History of Rock and Roll.

Regarding food, the food is packed lunches and sometimes the vegetables are overcooked. The portion is not a lot and the food tends to be really oily. The building of the grades 11 and 12 is really small. It doesn\u2019t have a library or a gym, we have to use the YMCA across the street.

Also in my years at WSHS I\u2019ve always been big on athletics and have joined the track, basketball, and football teams. While playing I\u2019ve noticed that the school spirit at WSHS is strong. The students  eagerly show their support for our teams by showing up to every game, cheering in the stands. In time I\u2019ve grown to have strong connections with both my teammates and our coaching staff. Furthermore on the academic side I\u2019d argue that our teachers challenge and push us to succeed.

They made communication easy and inspired him to work hard and stay focused.Comment:The faculty, some of whom have worked in admissions at colleges & universities, guided him through the application process and he was accepted into the elite college of which he'd dreamt.Comment:His teachers are responsive, willing to talk to us whenever, if ever, we have questions. I have the utmost respect for how they've treated my son.Comment:We are grateful to his teachers and the administration for the confidence they instilled in him.

Learning many skills and passions added to the bonus of the curriculum kept my mind always focused and engaged. There were many opportunities given to me by the school that I could better use in my now adult life such as volunteer work, teaching assistant, and even dual enrollment. That is not to say that there are not to be changes like how they advocate for trans and non binary students but do not have appropriate restrooms, those students are forced to go to the nurse to still feel comfortable in there bodies while relieving themselves.

The student body is incredibly diverse, but also very, very small. You\u2019ll generally know just about everyone in your grade at any given time.

The academic work is generally rigorous and the school is very focussed on college preparation. They start taking practice PSATs in like 7th grade or something, so by the time it counts they don't stress about it. If students want to accelerate their path in math, they can take self-guided courses over the summer, and pass an exam, but they have to be very independent learners to do this. They offer AP classes. I wish they had more science-informed practices around the school and more clubs and activities after school around science to live up to their name. One good thing is sometimes they have a class trip ice skating or roller skating...."

I wake up going to school feeling excited because the school has such a welcoming environment. The staff are there for you always, the academics are amazing. Over the past four years, I have taken in knowledge that I will use for the rest of my life. We have a plethora of clubs and sports for every single person. The faculty at North make you feel like you are their number 1 priority and are always there for you. I am very grateful for my four years attending and wouldn\u2019t trade it for anything...."

Most kids are very friendly and responsible, making them good people to be around. I find that it's sort of \"normal\" to be have straight A's here and be enrolled in Honors or AP classes, as most kids here do very well academically.  There is a wide variety of athletic teams, some of them being co-op with other neighboring schools. The facilities, such as the auditorium, weight room, gymnasiums, and science labs, are very nice! These facilities and other equipment in the school makes it possible to take electives not usually offered at other schools.Comment:Cons: Some of the teachers are inexperienced and often teach things we have already learned years past. Sometimes the school seems a little too small and cramped (though it makes it easy to get to classes on time). While not a ton of bullying takes place, when it does happen, the faculty doesn't do a lot about it...."

There used to be a waiting list for peoples kids to get into this school and most people couldn\u2019t or never did get their child into this school!! I like how there is TWO teachers in a class with ONLY 18-20 students, they are very productive in teaching , the school is very structured has Percs like Dance class for my daughter whom LOVES to dance and I can\u2019t afford to put her into a dance school/classes SO having dance AT school is a big plus ! Her teachers are ALWAYS awesome, SHE loves the school too I am just very pleased with the school overall.

It's at this point that I truly value the efforts of most teachers who genuinely strived to enhance our school experience to the best of their ability and the limited resources a city like Chelsea was able to provide! As time passed, I found my stride, and by senior year, I experienced a new sense of fun and fulfillment in many aspects of school life. This realization serves as a reminder that growth and memorable experiences often come from stepping outside of one's comfort zone, something I hope to work on in college to make the best out of my social life and taking care of myself.

Since September, our daughter has cultivated an incredible sense of community responsibility and discovered a newfound curiosity for the world and people around her. These aren't often things you say about a 3-year-old, but I attribute much of this to her new school and teachers. She now finds joy and pride in completing tasks on her own, but also knows she can ask for help from her older peers if needed. It truly is a school community. Every morning, she asks if it's a school day...when we answer yes, she responds with, \"Yippie!\"..."

But Braintree immediately made me feel like I belonged. Although the population is not the most diverse, it's definitely much more diverse than what I've been used to my whole life, which made me feel relieved and gave me hope that I really could fit in.

The only thing is that it is difficult to advance academically and choose your own classes if you make mistakes with your schedule as an underclassman. For example, if you don't take Honors Biology you will never be able to take an advanced course like AP Physics, AP Biology, or AP Environmental Science unless you either double up one year or drop a full year course like Band or a Foreign Language. This is because there are requirements like taking three years of gym which, although I understand, seems redundant for four-year athletes (which there are many of). This is the same case for math courses, as you will never reach AP Calc if you weren't immersed in the compacted math curriculum in middle school. Otherwise, there are many opportunities for students to get involved in club life or even make their own clubs, which is a great way to gain leadership experience...."

The small class sizes allow for individualized attention. This school has some of the most creative, unique, caring teachers that I\u2019ve ever encountered. The 5th grade teacher does a lot of project based learning that encompasses research, writing, presentations, creating a model (ex. a Mayan temple), and learning culturally relevant songs. The creative writing program is second to none. It is excellent preparation for their rigorous middle school program that will prepare them well for any high quality private or public high school. Our students are known for their comfort in public speaking; they get a lot of practice.  Comment: The small class sizes also allow the teachers to stay on top of monitoring social media etc. that our middle schoolers may be on. They are positioned well to make sure our kids navigate these waters safely and appropriately.  St. Joseph School is a gem!..."

The transition for 5th Grade last year exceeded our (high) expectations, not only from the deep engagement of the faculty and staff but also from the students' own participation in their experience. Fenn was the right choice for us because the community is uniquely skilled in understanding the needs of boys in this formative time of their lives; it shows in the ways they curate opportunities for students to take ownership of their  journeys, from studies to sports/clubs/music/etc. Boys have a real opportunity to thrive at Fenn, discovering who they are in a safe and supportive environment. We are a biracial family and have felt completely at home in Fenn's inclusive community. Our son absolutely loves it and is looking forward to starting Middle School this Fall, which is a testament unto its own!..."

It's focus on important values and its strong sense of community is like no other I've seen in the city. I've seen my very shy child truly blossom and grow her self confidence, while also thriving academically with a rigorous curriculum (which I've learned is one one of the best in the country) and excellent teachers to support her. The afterschool program is a gift to parents, and it's also a place where they find continued support. One of my favorite parts of afterschool is how they get to interact with kids at every class level, which I have found very beneficial as they develop their social skills.  It's the type of school where you have easy access to teachers and also the principal, whos door is always open. It's truly a special place!..."

Arts and sports at the middle school level are grouped by interest instead of merely grade, further expanding social options for students and building camaraderie and school pride among various peers. Academically, classes are interactive and appropriately challenging and seem to accommodate a variety of different styles of learning.

I'm glad that Our Lady's Academy starts standardized testing early on, as it well prepared me for my mid terms and finals in high school. Furthermore, Our Lady's does a good job of implementing the Christian faith into the education. The values that have been implemented into me from Our Lady's Academy have stuck with me and will continue to be an integral part of who I am.

Maybe it has just gotten better in the past years. The staff are always so kind and supportive, the teachers are highly qualified and trained from top colleges. They strive to help us and to incorporate Boston in our learning, though we don\u2019t go out every week in class, we might refer to architecture and go to trips around Boston, for example. The school also offers so many clubs and opportunities, this is how you meet people in other grades! I know almost everyone in the school and I am friends with several students in other grades, it is truly wonderful.

There are some teachers that should discipline students more when they don't show up to class or blatantly disrespect them. As a student who always shows up to class and does her work, it is frustrating for me to see that other students get away with not doing the work and don't get any kind of disciplinary retaliation in response to it. Resources at this school are one of a kind. We have plenty of chromebooks for people to use if they don't have personal computers, desktops in the library, an abundance of textbooks for each class, and many different expensive supplies for labs and demonstrations. Students are engaged out of class with field trips as well which adds to excitement and encourages learning. Since this school is small, the student culture is not the best.

Despite the impacts of the pandemic, Field was an excellent experience for her: an outstanding principal, committed teachers who balance academic rigor with social and emotional learning, a beautiful facility and setting near forests and the Lands Sake farm, and large roster of engaged parent volunteers. It was an ideal combination of resources. The administration managed as best as it seemingly could during the pandemic. Weston Public Schools score lower on diversity, but in my experience, given attendance by METCO students (bused in from Boston Public Schools) and the broad range of nationalities represented by expats residing in the town, my daughter had friends and classmates from all walks of life...."

The staff has always been receptive to their students, wanting them to succeed and providing extra help if needed. I do wish there was more emphasis on school culture, as academics often trump and distract from any sense of community. It would be nice to be a more unified school.

In light of some experiences, some of the best that I\u2019ve had at the school are all four years of pep rally, as well as junior prom, maybe it\u2019s just big things, but I feel really immersed and get a sense of normalcy when I am presented the \u201chigh school experience.\u201d Some of the worst experiences I remember, not even due to the school in particular, but due to the time it was, was Covid. The first couple months when I started high school academically speaking I wasn\u2019t where I wanted to be, but Covid made it 10 times harder.

BART is a relatively small school, so it's easy to build community and stick with it. The teachers here are very devoted to helping students learn---although you may not find yourself connecting with all teachers (if you know, you know).  Comment:Being a small school, BART has it's setbacks. The students here often joke about how laughably understaffed and \"broke\" this school is. I think that's a bit of an exaggeration, but it's partially rooted in truth. We don't have the budget for sustainable lunches. We tend to reuse food and settle for cheap (IF YOU KNOW, YOU KNOW).  Staff comes and goes. You may find yourself in a class without a teacher, instead alternating subs---though that isn't typical.Comment:Yet, this school does a great job at preparing students for college. Academically, this school exceeds. And again, it's easy to develop a strong community...."

I constantly felt supported and like I was being pushed to be the best version of myself. I do wish that I had been prepared for the outside world better but I do understand that that can be hard to teach. I would like to see more participation and engagement from the student angle.

You have the wonder the school looking for a bathroom that\u2019s unlocked which causes you to be away from class longer which defeats the whole purpose of the policy in the first place. It also doesn\u2019t stop kids from skipping class, it just harms the good kids more than anything.

Besides that I had teachers that I clearly remember were my eighth grade teachers my literature teacher and math teacher. These were two teachers I admired because my math teacher would always inform us of what's best for us and be helpful for those who were not interested in her class. She gave us advice like staying off of social media, to focus on what we do now as it will reflect our future, to always think before we made any serious decision, and more. My English  teacher  would always be ready to help and would be very mindful of those who were very intrigued by literature itself. Although I wasn't happy with the person I was I remember my former teachers words and appreciate them for all the decisions I make ...."

Overtime, I gained confidence in myself and started to advocate for myself. That consisted in creating a new spanish class for heritage speakers, joining equality club, and doing presentations/posters to raise awareness. Aside from the diversity APH has been such a great school. The academics have been a highlight at my school because we do a hands on learning which has helped me actually understand what I'm being taught and it has helped me grow confidence in myself. We have been able to share our ideas on assignments and have creative freedom. The great thing about APH is the close community between the teachers and the students. APH is home...."

Teachers will take all the time you need to help you with whatever you need as long as you put in the effort. Sturgis does not have food themselves, but they allow students to leave the campus for an hour to get lunch and just hangout and enjoy your time with friends.

The biggest downside from someone that loves sports and the competitiveness involved with them, is how Sturgis handles their sports. Sports feel like a rec team, where the goal is to have fun, and not to win. This is not a fun environment for someone who loves sports and their competitive nature. Overall though, Sturgis has prepared me greatly for college, and I love my decision of going...."

These relationships have not only made the academic challenges more bearable but have also been the source of countless cherished memories. On the flip side, the worst part has been the relentless pressure of academic expectations and the elusive pursuit of popularity. The stress of exams and the constant comparison to societal norms often overshadowed the joy of learning. If given the chance to influence change as a student, I would advocate for a more holistic education system\u2014one that prioritizes individual growth over rigid standards.

Despite this, academics are honestly quite strong, and individuals can feel prepared for higher education if they're willing to put in the work and hours.  Scituate has a remarkably solid trend of sending anywhere from 2-5 students per year to the nation's top colleges.  The administration this year has totally changed, which has been poorly managed and aimed solely at stifling senior \"privileges\" and hounding minor infractions while ignoring the drug problems the school continues to struggle with.  The fine arts department is fantastic; the STEM opportunities are student-driven but supported by devoted faculty, as long as you're not interested in taking engineering courses.

I've made some of my best friends here, and discovered what I wanted to do for the rest of my life within these walls. Every teacher is different, so I can't really group them all together as a whole, but for the most part I've learned a lot from them. If I had to change anything about this school it would be the disregard for the arts in some senses. I am part of the dance team and we are continuously pushed aside for the other sports at the school. The principal is also a soccer coach, so he sees things from that point of view...."

She would always have writing templates and supplemental visual materials that I could use whenever needed. Despite her support, she always kept high expectations, knowing I could always do better. For example, in our identity unit, I had to create a project about who I am. I wrote a letter to no one in particular. Ms. Moore saw my potential and pushed me to do better. I wrote seven poems representing myself. When she graded me; She mentioned my growth in changing and adjusting, creativity, and vulnerability I have shown. I completed the project in English and Spanish and still, I sometimes look back at it for a quick reminder of who I am and who I would like my future to be.

Communication was okay but not as good as it could have been given the size of the school.  Follow through was in essence non existent.

There is very great education, the teachers help everyone understand, and will help each and every student succeed. There is pretty good sports. The food served in the cafeteria is very delicious. Although  the COVID-19 pandemic, there is still hot lunch. Since the virus is still around, the school decided to let the lunches be free, especially since about 15% of the children's families are in debt and don't have a lot to eat. That is my summary of CMS. Definitely recommend this school!..."

It's a small public high school offering the IB curriculum for free which I'm very thankful for. IB is naturally difficult than a regular high school, but our teachers are mostly very prepared to guide us to success.  Since the amount of students are small, and majority of them have known each other since kindergarten, it can be tiring to see the same people daily, but having such a tight community has benefits. Teachers can learn about your personal life, and accommodate to your needs much better. JQUS is more academic focused than arts or sports which is a bummer for me personally, but we become much more college prepared before other students. I know JQUS as a school try their very best to be there for us in many ways. The community gets better as times goes on, especially with society becoming much more open-minded..."

I have a good number of teachers who make me feel as though I belong, and that I will achieve great things, but my experience cannot be said for all--this is something I hope may change. Where every student, no matter their differences feel as though they are somewhere they can be themselves and flourish in, be it clubs dedicated to their hobbies or interests, or elective classes that they may find interesting, or even just a teacher that they can connect strongly with. All these factors make a school a close community, and one day we'll be able to get there as more students and administrators insist on change...."

For example, their babysitting program that went alongside with their English learning program for parents, were cut due to lack support and due to covid.Comment:Overall, what I would like see changed would be their funding, most schools have a lot of support on their funding but from my experience we weren't given a lot of luxuries, if anything we were given a lot of false promises, most of them would have been avoided per proper funding and support...."

However at McAuliffe, they do their best to shape their students into better individuals. The teachers there put so much time and effort into their work and they want their students to have the best possible opportunities. There is an extensive range of clubs as well as many sports offered. The school is smaller than the other middle schools in town, but it fosters a welcoming and tight knit community. Instead of regular \"specials\" (gym, music, art) they offer unique classes (Adventure, Wellness, and T4L2/Design) that are different every year. Not every loves this school, but I think that it is a wonderful opportunity to grow not just as students but as young adults...."

I was chosen to represent our school\u2019s Early College Program in a Boston Globe article where I shared my experience as a participant in the first year of the program at my school. These college classes not only prepare us for the college classroom environment with other college students, but also allow us to explore what career we may want to pursue after high school. Fenway High does an amazing job to help us not only in academics but also beyond that and extends to college preparatory level.

The school spends more time on Project Based Learning and Social Emotional Learning than most schools in Cambridge, which contribute greatly to the school's atmosphere. Teachers and staff alike are dedicated and highly skilled. King Open also houses the Ol\u00e1 Program, Cambridge's dual immersion Portuguese language track (you need to sign up for this program separately in the lottery). Ol\u00e1 teaches children in Portuguese half the day and English half the day. No Portuguese knowledge or background is needed (most kids in the classes don't have any connection to Portuguese). King Open will be moving into a brand new facility in Fall 2019. Love this school and community!..."

At every grade level, the teachers are exceptional and create deep, nurturing relationships with students.  Shore institutions like the Big Buddy program, the House System and the 3rd grade Olympic festival are foundational experiences for students and bring out the best in both children and adults on campus.  Upper School sports (grades 6-9) were a great opportunity to try new things, mix with students in other grade levels and share school spirit.  There are tons of opportunities for parents to volunteer and be a part of the community as well.  We are so thankful to have found Shore!..."

I also attended the curriculum night a few weeks ago and was incredibly impressed with the school set-up, the daily processes they go through, the specific work they cover and the quantifiable results that are occurring for my son.  I understand how difficult it may be with students at this age re-integrating back into school and I wanted to wait a month or so before writing a review, but I couldn't imagine our son feeling more supported and prioritized to excel.  North Grafton Elementary is fantastic, and thank you to every teacher, faculty member, staff and parent that does their best here...."

However, I would like to see a change in ARHS's math department, which does not support its students as much as would be wanted. Many students, therefore, are afraid of math or believe that they can not do math. The administration can act if swayed to do so. The history hallway and classes are nice.

I remember vividly getting harassed nearly everyday for not fitting in. There was one day when I got punched by another student, and so as a naive kindergartner, I told my teacher that someone punched me in the face.  But the teacher just straight up called me a liar. The next time the person punched me, I returned a punch, as per the Golden Rule - Treat others the way you want to be treated. The teacher saw us fight and ended up pulling me to the side, yelling at me. My year as a kindergartner ruined my self-esteem and changed me into a very shy person, becoming always scared of the surroundings.

However, there were times when I felt excluded, especially when it came to athletics. But, I did not let that moment define me or stifle my hard work. With the help of my friends and family, I pushed myself to the limit and worked to show how this setback would exhibit my perseverance and grit. And when I completed the hard work, it yielded great results.

Comment:The one misgiving I hav is that foreign language is not offered until 6th grade.

I myself am part of the jazz band, Nordic skiing team, and was part of the Russian club while it was in session.  Classes themselves are also very interesting; there are many arts classes, such as fiber arts, black & white photography, and color theory. There are also CAD, videography, and computer animation classes, some of which have several courses varying in difficulty. As for the core subjects, ARHS is very strong in all of them - I would say that, having spoken to many people who have attended college during my own applications process, our school strongly prepares anyone who is interested in higher education. If I had to see one change made, it would probably be to the experimental schedule system they implemented during online school, with less frequent classes that are longer each day...."

I really enjoyed extracurriculars such as ROTC and watching sports games, where I had gotten the chance to meet people from Commerce and even other schools in the district. The suckier parts of my experience was definitely the time during the pandemic, where schools in my area were fully-remote for a year and a half. SHA is a very academics-heavy school which was beneficial in some ways, but came with burden of added stress. The one thing I'd change would be the opportunities. Since this is a low-income district, there is less funding & less resources.Comment:Overall, it was a wild ride I'll never forget...."

To give you a full understanding of my opinions, let me tell you a little about my time in the MURSD District. After attending the district from Kindergarten to eighth grade I felt the need for a change of scenery, culture, etc. So I journeyed 45 minutes to a private school in a different state. Although academically everything was outstanding, the long commute proved to be too much for my family causing the transfer back. However, upon returning from a diverse, academically well-rounded private school to a government-funded public school, my idea of good academics and educated teachers changed. I realized the importance of learning in an environment where students and teachers have similar desires for education. I want to walk into a classroom and see kids learning with invested teachers, parents who are eager to help out of school, and an overall drive to better the students...."

The 5th grade teacher does a lot of project based learning that encompasses research, writing, presentations, creating a model (ex. a Mayan temple), and learning culturally relevant songs. The creative writing program is second to none. It is excellent preparation for their rigorous middle school program that will prepare them well for any high quality private or public high school. Our students are known for their comfort in public speaking; they get a lot of practice.  Comment: The small class sizes also allow the teachers to stay on top of monitoring social media etc. that our middle schoolers may be on. They are positioned well to make sure our kids navigate these waters safely and appropriately.  St. Joseph School is a gem!..."

My child's teacher was excellent. I wish the teacher to child ratio was smaller (it averages 21:1), but the teachers do a good job and the parent association is active and involved.

I enjoy our small community, and the 67 students graduating alongside me. We have a close knit relationship with the other grades as well as our teachers, which is a benefit compared to a regular public school.

And the teachers are willing to stay after school or for lunch to work on topics that you might not understand. Despite the aforementioned challenges, I would not leave this school if I was forced.

It's an inclusion school so they don't segregate the kids with ILP'S which I think is pretty messed up to begin with and they focus time teaching the kids to be inclusive what that truly means and to be kind and accepting of people who might be different from you. We came from a very wealthy small country town which I assume their schools budget out weighs this schools budget by a massive amount yet my child gets better education here, more teachers, smaller classes, extra curricular activities, more field trips, cooler hands on learning experiences not sure how but they make it happen..."

Students have a very close community along with each other and teachers throughout the building and multiple grades. The work load is a lot and can be very stressful. However the opportunity to learn Chinese is very cool and they have a great program, especially if you start in Kindergarten, to help students pick up the language quick. Comment:As far as offerings outside of academics, there are many different clubs available to high schoolers. The sports program is slowly growing and we have many amazing teams that are doing very well and increasing in strength every year. The school does put on some fun events throughout the year, such as movie nights, prom, etc., but those are also limited.

In all of my courses, the teachers I have had have been passionate and knowledgeable in their fields, but also understanding and accepting of any extraneous circumstances. Further, Oliver Ames offers a wide range of courses to take and extracurricular activities to choose from. However, there were a few parts of my experience that were not as satisfactory; specifically, I would like to see the implementation of more mental health resources and career pathway opportunities.

Comment:Improvement - the drop off and pick up better known as the loop. Town needs to open up the access road so we can exit school .  Time consuming with just one exit due to fact that Dpw uses it too. They have huge construction equipment trying to get out and all the family cars trying to get in and out...."

        "review": "Comment:Senior:A huge weight on my high school experience was COVID-19. I never thought my freshman year of high school would be jeopardized by a world wide virus restricting me from meeting new people and forming friendships. My school handled this very well, although we had to wear masks and remain 6 feet apart, they made sure we were welcomed to our new school. Fast forward four years later, we are mask free, no social distancing, the world has a handle on COVID and everything is relatively back to \"normal\". The summer going into my senior year, I find out all sports teams and Bishop Fenwick are not allowed to play in the MIAA playoffs. Now it wasn't a virus jeopardizing my senior year, but a mistake made by my school's administration. With Fenwick taking pride in our sports teams this was a huge loss. Fenwick's perseverance through this situation is why I chose to go there my freshman year and why I am proud to say I am alumni of Bishop Fenwick...."

        "review": "Comment:Middle School Student:McCarthy is overall it is a pretty good school. But my biggest problem is that I feel like if you are gifted and prone to success you will definitely excel. But if you are a weaker student, the school does very little to help you get better. The teachers are very varied. Some are very kind, supportive, and effective, while other give off a vibe that they hate their job or the students. Safety is pretty average. Fights happen every so often among the older students. I think that the biggest thing this school has going for it, are the clubs. There are 15+ different clubs run by teacher that are fun. Another big thing this school has going for it is the culture. McCarthy has a great sense of pride shared by students and staff alike. We have spirit weeks, food can drives, marathons, socials, movie nights just to name a few. Overall McCarthy is a very decent school that, with enough hard work, can get kids far in life. Anyways, I should keep working on my homework...."
